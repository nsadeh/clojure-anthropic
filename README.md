# clojure-anthropic

A Clojure interface for the [Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api)

This package was quickly developed and is in pre-alpha. Feel free to use, but I make no guarantees about reliability/performance and whether it will continue to be maintained.

## Usage

Currently, the only endpoint we support is the [messages](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/messages_post) endpoint. It mirrors the API documentation closely.

## Todos

- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Support for multiple Anthropic API versions
